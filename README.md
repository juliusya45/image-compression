# image-compression
This is a repo for our image compression algorithm that we developed in EECS 50 (Discrete Time Signals) as an extra credit project. It utilizes a discrete cosine transform to compress images. The end result is an image with the same resolution but takes half the space.

## Original Image:
![bit-256-x-256-Grayscale-Lena-Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bafc504-b0b0-4755-bc6c-5d69900dd731)

## Compressed Image:

As we can see from these 2 images of Lena we can still identify her with the compressed image but it takes up roughly half the sapce. This method of compression is used all around image processing and was developed in Python.
